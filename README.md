# Fraction Calculator Frontend

A basic application for addition of fractions. This application was made in order to teach myself about .dll files and how to make an application with two diffrent languages.

The backend is written in CalculateFractionsDll.dll usign C++, Dll_i_csharp.dll converts the C++ code to C# and Csharpdll.dll is a wrapper class.

The frontend is written in C# using Visual Studio forms.
