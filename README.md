# Fraction Calculator Frontend
## Description
A basic frontend application for a calculator, which was made in order to teach myself about .dll files and how to make an application with diffrent languages.
The application is written in C#.

The application backend is written in C++ in CalculateFractionsDll.dll, which is then converted to C# with Dll_i_csharp.dll and simplified in Csharpdll.dll.
